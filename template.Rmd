##Problem 1 
  Variable types & coercion
  
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

hw_1 = tibble( 
samp = rnorm(10),
gr_0 = samp > 0,
vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j" ),
vec_level = factor(c("high", "medium", "low", "medium", "high", "low", "high", "medium", "high", "low"))
 )

hw_1

mean(pull(hw_1, var = samp))
mean(pull(hw_1, var = gr_0))
mean(pull(hw_1, var = vec_char))
mean(pull(hw_1, var = vec_level))
```

I am able to take the mean of the variable "samp," which is the random sample size of 10 that follows a normal distribution. 
I am also able to take the mean of the variable "gr_0," which is the summ of the variables that are greater than 0. 
I am unable to take the mean for vec_char and vec_level because those are not numeric, instead they are characters.
